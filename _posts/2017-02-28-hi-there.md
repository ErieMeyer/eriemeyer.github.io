Finally publishing a beta of my personal site. It's sort of interesting how we're unable to take our own advice -- this has been in beta for, say, 15 years? This would not fly on any work project of mine.

It was important to me to build it myself, and to use OSS, but as I've spent my technical hours fighting PDFs or pinch hitting, I never got the ready-made templates in a simple-enough format to love them. 

God bless Jekyll, and God bless [http://jmcglone.com](Jonathan McGlone)'s fantastic work to make building a site like this blisteringly simple. More to come!
